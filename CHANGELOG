- I ran Clang-Format on all the original Quake2 source files to fix multiple
  formatting issues and replace tabs with spaces, so that it displays nicely
  and uniformly on all browsers and editors. The Clang-Format style file used
  can be found at the root of the project. I tried to tune it to maintain the
  overall style used by id, so the code should look pretty much the same as
  before, but with the advantage of uniform indenting and spacing through.

- Changes made by me in the Quake2 source code are usually annotated by a nearby
  comment stating the change made and sometimes the date when it was first
  made. These comments will start with my name (e.g.: LAMPERT), followed
  by a brief description.

- Other minor changes such as removing or adding blank lines, adding curly
  braces to flow-control statements, adding `static` to local functions or data,
  are not always marked with comments to avoid excessive verbosity.

- The vast majority of the code related to the PS2 port is located inside the
  src/ps2/ directory. Changes made in the Quake2 source to account for the
  PlayStation2 are clearly marked as such.
