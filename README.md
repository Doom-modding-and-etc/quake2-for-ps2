![quake console](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/glampert/quake2-for-ps2/master/misc/screens/sample-qconsole-ps2.jpg "quake console")

## Overview

This is an unofficial fan made port, targeting the PS2 Console, of the original
[Quake II source code released by id Software][link_id_repo].

This port relies on the free [PS2DEV SDK][link_ps2_dev] to provide rendering,
input, audio and system services for the Quake Engine.

The project is in early development stage, but 2D rendering of menus and cinematics
is already implemented and working on both the emulator and the PS2, as you can see
in the above screenshot of the in-game console running on the PS2.

The long term goal is to have a fully functional and playable (single-player)
Quake II on the PlayStation 2, using only on the freely available tools and libraries.
